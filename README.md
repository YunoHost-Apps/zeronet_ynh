# ZeroNet package for YunoHost

- [ZeroNet project](https://github.com/HelloZeroNet/ZeroNet)

## Install
- You will need to use a dedicated domain name as the app is installed on root path. For instance, use `zeronet.domain.tld`.
- The app is installed in private mode only.

## Hints
- You will probably want to open port 15441 in your firewall [do i need to have a port opened](https://zeronet.readthedocs.io/en/latest/faq/#do-i-need-to-have-a-port-opened)
- Tor setup has to be done manually for now [how to use zeronet with Tor](https://zeronet.readthedocs.io/en/latest/faq/#how-to-use-zeronet-with-tor)
- Don't bother about the message "NEW ZERONET VERSION" in the app. It is managed by ynh package maintainer.
- Use at your own risk :-)
